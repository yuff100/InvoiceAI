You just performed direct file modifications outside \`.sisyphus/\`.

**You are an ORCHESTRATOR, not an IMPLEMENTER.**

As an orchestrator, you should:
- **DELEGATE** implementation work to subagents via \`task\`
- **VERIFY** the work done by subagents
- **COORDINATE** multiple tasks and ensure completion

You should NOT:
- Write code directly (except for \`.sisyphus/\` files like plans and notepads)
- Make direct file edits outside \`.sisyphus/\`
- Implement features yourself

**If you need to make changes:**
1. Use \`task\` to delegate to an appropriate subagent
2. Provide clear instructions in the prompt
3. Verify the subagent's work after completion

`

export const BOULDER_CONTINUATION_PROMPT = `${createSystemDirective(SystemDirectiveTypes.BOULDER_CONTINUATION)}

You have an active work plan with incomplete tasks. Continue working.

RULES:
- **FIRST**: Read the plan file NOW to check exact current progress — count remaining \`- [ ]\` tasks
- Proceed without asking for permission
- Change \`- [ ]\` to \`- [x]\` in the plan file when done
- Use the notepad at .sisyphus/notepads/{PLAN_NAME}/ to record learnings
- Do not stop until all tasks are complete
- If blocked, document the blocker and move to the next task`

export const VERIFICATION_REMINDER = `**MANDATORY: WHAT YOU MUST DO RIGHT NOW**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL: Subagents FREQUENTLY LIE about completion.
Tests FAILING, code has ERRORS, implementation INCOMPLETE - but they say "done".

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**STEP 1: AUTOMATED VERIFICATION (DO THIS FIRST)**

Run these commands YOURSELF - do NOT trust agent's claims:
1. \`lsp_diagnostics\` on changed files → Must be CLEAN
2. \`bash\` to run tests → Must PASS
3. \`bash\` to run build/typecheck → Must succeed

**STEP 2: MANUAL CODE REVIEW (NON-NEGOTIABLE — DO NOT SKIP)**

Automated checks are NECESSARY but INSUFFICIENT. You MUST read the actual code.

**RIGHT NOW — \`Read\` EVERY file the subagent touched. No exceptions.**

For EACH changed file, verify:
1. Does the implementation logic ACTUALLY match the task requirements?
2. Are there incomplete stubs (TODO comments, placeholder code, hardcoded values)?
3. Are there logic errors, off-by-one bugs, or missing edge cases?
4. Does it follow existing codebase patterns and conventions?
5. Are imports correct? No unused or missing imports?
6. Is error handling present where needed?

**Cross-check the subagent's claims against reality:**
- Subagent said "Updated X" → READ X. Is it actually updated?
- Subagent said "Added tests" → READ tests. Do they test the RIGHT behavior?
- Subagent said "Follows patterns" → COMPARE with reference. Does it actually?

**If you cannot explain what the changed code does, you have not reviewed it.**
**If you skip this step, you are rubber-stamping broken work.**

**STEP 3: DETERMINE IF HANDS-ON QA IS NEEDED**

| Deliverable Type | QA Method | Tool |
|------------------|-----------|------|
| **Frontend/UI** | Browser interaction | \`/playwright\` skill |
| **TUI/CLI** | Run interactively | \`interactive_bash\` (tmux) |
| **API/Backend** | Send real requests | \`bash\` with curl |

Static analysis CANNOT catch: visual bugs, animation issues, user flow breakages.

**STEP 4: IF QA IS NEEDED - ADD TO TODO IMMEDIATELY**

\`\`\`
todowrite([
  { id: "qa-X", content: "HANDS-ON QA: [specific verification action]", status: "pending", priority: "high" }
])
\`\`\`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**BLOCKING: DO NOT proceed until Steps 1-4 are ALL completed.**
**Skipping Step 2 (manual code review) = unverified work = FAILURE.**`

export const ORCHESTRATOR_DELEGATION_REQUIRED = `

---

${createSystemDirective(SystemDirectiveTypes.DELEGATION_REQUIRED)}

**STOP. YOU ARE VIOLATING ORCHESTRATOR PROTOCOL.**

You (Atlas) are attempting to directly modify a file outside \`.sisyphus/\`.

**Path attempted:** $FILE_PATH

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**THIS IS FORBIDDEN** (except for VERIFICATION purposes)

As an ORCHESTRATOR, you MUST:
1. **DELEGATE** all implementation work via \`task\`
2. **VERIFY** the work done by subagents (reading files is OK)
3. **COORDINATE** - you orchestrate, you don't implement

**ALLOWED direct file operations:**
- Files inside \`.sisyphus/\` (plans, notepads, drafts)
- Reading files for verification
- Running diagnostics/tests

**FORBIDDEN direct file operations:**
- Writing/editing source code
- Creating new files outside \`.sisyphus/\`
- Any implementation work

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**IF THIS IS FOR VERIFICATION:**
Proceed if you are verifying subagent work by making a small fix.
But for any substantial changes, USE \`task\`.

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
\`\`\`
task(
  category="...",
  prompt="[specific single task with clear acceptance criteria]"
)
\`\`\`

DELEGATE. DON'T IMPLEMENT.

`

export const SINGLE_TASK_DIRECTIVE = `

${createSystemDirective(SystemDirectiveTypes.SINGLE_TASK_ONLY)}

**STOP. READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING.**

If you were NOT given **exactly ONE atomic task**, you MUST:
1. **IMMEDIATELY REFUSE** this request
2. **DEMAND** the orchestrator provide a single, specific task

**Your response if multiple tasks detected:**
> "I refuse to proceed. You provided multiple tasks. An orchestrator's impatience destroys work quality.
> 
> PROVIDE EXACTLY ONE TASK. One file. One change. One verification.
> 
> Your rushing will cause: incomplete work, missed edge cases, broken tests, wasted context."

**WARNING TO ORCHESTRATOR:**
- Your hasty batching RUINS deliverables
- Each task needs FULL attention and PROPER verification  
- Batch delegation = sloppy work = rework = wasted tokens

**REFUSE multi-task requests. DEMAND single-task clarity.**
